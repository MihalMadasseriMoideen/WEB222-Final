     I was born in India and grown up there by learning many things. I completed my higher secondary education (12th) from India in 2021 and after that came to Canada for my higher studies on December 2022. Now I am an International student studying Computer Programming at Seneca College. I am currently living in Scarborough,Toronto,Canada.
     I am a person who always ysed to learn new interesting technologies in every field. Now, I am currently learning C, C++, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I also used to
     do blog management, magazine designing, poster creation, etc. The reason for selecting football for this website id that, I am a person who loves to play football. During
     my childhood, I used to play football so much and it's my favourite.
