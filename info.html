                <p>
                    Football is one of the gameplay which is known all over the world. In 19th century the modern football was introduced at Britain. Before that it's used to be played by people in towns and villages.
                    During that time there was custom rules created by the playing people and the rules changes according to the places and people. Later some schools and residence teams taken that as winter game. During that time also the situation of rules was same. Each school had different rules.
                    Later for conducting tournaments the University of Cambridge made a rule for all students. Later in 1863 there was many meetings and finally they accomplished the rules for football, in that they removed the carrying of ball by hand. They decided to allow only goalkeepers to use their hands to carry ball during the gameplay.
                    Later started to undertake competitions between schools, residence, places, etc and finally it become the popular game and now there are matches played between countries.
